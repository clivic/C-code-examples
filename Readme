These are the C++ code examples I wrote when I was learning C++.

Categories:
1. C++ tests and problem solving: These are the programs I wrote when I was learning C++, apart from the assignments. Some of them are exercises on a coding practice website.
2. Course Assignments: These include the assignments I wrote for C++ and Data Structure courses. I impmlemented some of the C++ library classes to learn the concept as well.
3. OpenGL, DirectX, OpenCV: These are the graphical programs I wrote in C++ using OpenGL/DirectX/OpenCV. The DirectX and OpenGL programs are course works.
4. Programs: These are the practice programs I wrote when I was learning C++, including both graphical interface apps (Picture Manager), and console apps (Game -- Tic-Tac-Toe).

// Please be advised:
// (Nearly) All of the programs in this repository were written in VC6. So in order to run the exe files in the Debug folder, for example, the "Game -- Tic-Tac-Toe", you need "MSVCP120D.dll".

Thanks.
